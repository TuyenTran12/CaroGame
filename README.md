## III. Introduction to Caro Gameplay
Caro is an engaging and strategic board game that offers various exciting gameplay features. Players can create an account through a simple registration process or log in if they already have an account. The game supports LAN multiplayer mode, allowing players on the same network to compete with each other. Additionally, players can connect and play across different networks using VPN services or directly via IP addresses, making it easy to challenge friends from anywhere.  

The gameplay is straightforward yet challenging: the first player to align 5 marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the match. Winners earn points based on their performance, and high scores are recorded on the leaderboard to showcase the top players.  

For solo players, Caro offers an AI mode with 5 distinct difficulty levels, ranging from beginner-friendly Level 1 to the highly challenging Level 5. This ensures a balanced experience for all skill levels, providing endless opportunities to hone your strategy and enjoy the game.
